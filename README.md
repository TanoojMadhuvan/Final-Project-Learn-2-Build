# Final-Project-Learn-2-Build
 This is the final project being created and submitted by Tanooj, Rohan, Kamran, and Priscilla to the Learn 2 Build Hackathon.

How to install and play game:
1. Download the folder called "DOWNLOAD_THIS_TO_PLAY_GAME"
2. Check to see if .exe file and .pck file are both in the same folder locally
3. Double click the .exe file to run the game

All assets of images, sounds, pixel art, fonts, etc were taken from open source sites.
All of the character assets, enemy assets, tilemap pixel art was shared by itch.io for free.
Sounds were shared for free by chosic.com and mixkit.


Game Context:
You are on a post-apocalyptic island with trash all around you.
You were littering on island and throwing trash from your pocket.
However, you accidentally threw away your credit card as well.
You need to remember and search all the places you think you littered to pick up your trash and potentially find your credit card.
Orcs and soldiers on the island have gone mad as polluters and want to attack you.
You have limited time to find the trash sites.
Move towards "warmer/hotter" regions and don't search in "cool/cold" regions.


This game showcases the necessity to remain environmentally cautious, since everything that is thrown as pollution
must be picked up eventually. Social change is required to understand the effects of over-pollution.
Otherwise, landfills and trash will only come back to hurt everyone.
